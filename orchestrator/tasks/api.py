"""Public API for maintainer-side operations on a Choir project repo.

Three primitives:

- :func:`create_task_issue` — create one issue from a TaskRecord
- :func:`list_choir_tasks`  — enumerate existing Choir issues
- :func:`get_task`          — read one issue back as a TaskRecord

These are intentionally low-level. Composing them (batch-creating
issues for a benchmark, building a leaderboard, polling status) is
the overseer's job — Choir provides the primitives, not the policies.

All operations go through `gh`; the maintainer is expected to be
authenticated locally (`gh auth login`). Choir does not see or
forward credentials.
