"""Deterministic change-poller — the orchestrator loop's clock.

An LLM agent has no innate timer; "check every 10 minutes" is prose
until something mechanical does the waiting. This module is that
mechanism: it snapshots the repo's Choir-relevant state (open PRs +
their check status, open task issues + their labels), then re-checks
on a fixed interval and **exits as soon as something changed**,
printing a JSON summary of what. The agent runs it as a blocking /
background subprocess and reacts when it exits — zero LLM cost while
idle, and the cadence is enforced by the subprocess, not by the
agent's memory.

CLI::

    python -m orchestrator.poll --repo owner/name \
        [--interval 600] [--max-wait 3600] [--once] [--prover lean4]

`--repo` / `--interval` / `--max-wait` default to the values in
`~/.choir/orchestrator.toml` (see `orchestrator.local_config`).
`--once` prints the current snapshot and exits (initial stock-take).
`--prover` (default: unset, strict) threads the project's prover into the
mergeability read — this poller has no local checkout to resolve it from
`.choir/project.toml` itself, unlike `merge_pr`'s caller, so pass it
explicitly (see `main`'s `--prover` help for the concrete divergence this
closes).

Exit codes:
    0 — change detected (JSON summary on stdout)
    1 — bad arguments / no repo configured
    2 — GitHub error on the initial snapshot (auth, network, repo)
    3 — max-wait reached with no change (JSON with empty changes)

Transient errors *during* the wait are tolerated (logged to stderr,
retried next tick) so an overnight run survives rate-limit blips.

def _checks_state(pr: PRView, *, prover: str | None = None) -> str:
    """"pending" / "green" / "red" — mergeability, not every check.

    Deliberately the same predicates `merge_pr`'s preflight uses
    (`gate.checks` via `blocking_failures` / `missing_required_checks`), not
    `checks_all_green`, which counts advisory checks too. Two consequences of
    that older reading were wrong here: a PR failing only `style` or `review`
    read as red, and a slow-but-genuinely-advisory check still running after
    the blocking set went green would hold a fully-green PR at "pending"
    until it finished too. (`verify-comparator`'s own `timeout-minutes: 60`
    no longer illustrates the second case: the check is blocking now, note
    14 §8, so holding a PR pending while it runs is the correct read, not a
    bug — see `test_pending_comparator_holds_a_pr_pending` in
    `tests/orchestrator/test_poll.py`.)

    `prover` is forwarded to `blocking_failures` / `pending_blocking_checks`
    unchanged — never defaulted to a specific prover here — so this reads
    mergeability *the way `merge_pr` does* only when both are called with the
    same prover; the default `None` is the strict reading both fall back to.
    `missing_required_checks` takes no `prover`: presence is not
    prover-dependent (a per-prover-inapplicable audit like `decide-instance`
    or `comparator` reports a green not-applicable line rather than being
    absent — see `gate.checks.REQUIRED_PRESENT`'s docstring), so there is
    nothing for a keyword to mean there.

    Trade-off, accepted: an advisory check finishing *after* the blocking set
    goes green produces no state transition, so no wakeup. The orchestrator
    reads the full PR when it acts on the green, and can see there that an
    advisory check is still running.
