"""PR primitives for the orchestrator agent.

The review/merge half of the orchestrator loop: list open PRs with
their deterministic-audit status, read the diff, post review feedback,
and merge or close — all through the overseer's local `gh` auth.

The merge decision itself is the agent's job (and is governed by the
project's automation level — see `orchestrator.project_config`). These
functions never decide anything; they read and execute.

Choir's trust floor does not rest on branch protection here. Protection is
unavailable on private repos without a paid plan, and once spec D4's
`enforce_admins: false` bootstrap lands the owner — whose auth the
orchestrator uses — is exempt by design. `merge_pr` therefore enforces the
gate itself: it refuses any PR whose blocking checks are not green, or whose
required checks never ran.

What that enforcement does *not* cover: it verifies the checks that ran, by
name and conclusion, so it cannot detect a PR that changed *which* checks
run — a stub job carrying a required name, or an existing workflow whose
`run:` step was gutted, both look green. Closing that needs a protected-paths
gate audit (the 2026-05-07 decision, still unimplemented). Until then the
orchestrator refuses any PR touching `.github/` or `.choir/` outright — see
`docs/agents/ORCHESTRATOR.md` § Boundaries.

    per loop and passes it in, so an omitted prover gets the strict
    (base `gate.checks.CHECKS`) answer rather than silently un-gating a
    prover this function has never heard of.

    The preflight is not redundant with branch protection. Protection is
    unavailable on free private repos, and once spec D4's
    `enforce_admins: false` bootstrap lands the orchestrator runs on the
    owner's auth and the owner is exempt, so GitHub does not constrain this
    call at any automation level — this check is the enforcement. Its bound:
    it judges the checks that ran, so it cannot see a PR that changed which
    checks run (module docstring).

    The PR view is fetched here rather than accepted from the caller: a stale
    view is a bypass. A required check that never ran at all (its workflow
    was deleted on the PR's own branch) is refused exactly like a failing
    one — see `missing_required_checks`. The merge itself is pinned to the
    exact head commit the checks were just read against
    (`--match-head-commit`), so a push landing between the read and the
    merge cannot ride through underneath a check that was genuinely green a
    moment ago.

    **`force` is overseer-authorized.** It exists for the human who owns the
    project, not for the orchestrator's own judgment: an autonomous agent
    that overrides its only enforcement when a check looks inconvenient has
    no enforcement. A check that stays red for reasons outside the diff is an
    escalation, and the orchestrator keeps working everything else meanwhile
    (`docs/agents/ORCHESTRATOR.md` § Automation levels, § Boundaries).

    `force` takes a non-blank reason string, never a bare truthy value — the
    obvious wrong idiom after seeing this function refuse is `force=True`,
    which would merge silently with no attributable reason, so that and any
    non-string or blank value are rejected outright. The reason, plus
    whatever it overrode, is posted to the PR before merging, so an override
    is never silent and remains auditable after the fact — and the override
    path is pinned to `pr.head_sha` too, so the commit that merges is the one
    the trail names. The posted state names the prover the override was
    resolved against: `blocking_failures`/`missing_required_checks` only
    surface checks that are actually blocking *for that prover*, so a check
    that is visibly red but relaxed to advisory there (`statement-equiv` on
    lean4) would otherwise vanish from the trail entirely — "all required
    checks were green" is true of the resolved answer, not of every check's
    literal conclusion, and a human auditing the override wants to see that
    distinction, not have it silently folded away. `method` is one of
