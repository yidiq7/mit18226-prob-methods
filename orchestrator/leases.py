"""Bring the lifecycle labels into line with the lease comments.

Spec D4 takes write access away from contributors, so a worker can no longer
move `choir/available` to `choir/claimed`. The orchestrator can, so it does.

**The label is no longer the lease.** It is a projection of the comment
thread, maintained on a loop, for humans skimming the board and for `choir
list`'s cheap filter. Correctness lives in the comments: two workers racing
both read the thread and compute the same winner
(`gate.state.lease_arbiter`), so nothing depends on a label being current at
the instant of a claim.

The consequence, stated rather than engineered away: **between orchestrator
runs a claimed task can still read `choir/available`**, so `choir list` may
over-report what is free. Deliberately not fixed — `claim` reads the
comments before doing anything, so a second worker attracted by a stale
label discovers the live claim and backs off. Making the label
authoritative would mean either a gate workflow (which D4's no-arbiter
design avoids) or a comment fetch per listed issue.

    stays testable without the network.

    `now` is resolved once for the whole sweep, not per issue: two issues
    decided against clocks a minute apart could straddle the staleness
    boundary differently, and one instant per sweep is the agreement this
    module exists to preserve.

    Preserves the single-state-label invariant from the 2026-05-10 decision:
    exactly one lifecycle label at a time, so each change is a paired
    add/remove rather than an add that leaves two.

    Only `available` <-> `claimed` are touched. An issue already
    `choir/in-review`, `choir/done` or `choir/invalid` is left alone: those
    states are downstream of a merged or rejected PR, not the lease's
    business, and stomping one from lease data would undo a decision the
