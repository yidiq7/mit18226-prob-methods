"""Pure scanning logic for the trust-boundary inventory.

Shares the regex heuristics of `gate.verify.axiom_honesty` (axiom
names) and `gate.indexer.extract` (declaration headers), but strips
comments first — the inventory is a planning document and false
positives from doc-strings ("this lemma replaces a sorry") would make
it useless. The verify audits deliberately do NOT strip comments
(over-counting is safe when gating); here under-noise matters more.

Comment stripping, declaration-boundary attribution, and the
placeholder scan are all parameterized by a `gate.provers.ProverProfile`
(default `lean4`, so every existing caller/test is unchanged — design
note 12 §2/§3). Axiom-name inventorying (`AxiomItem`) stays lean4's
`axiom NAME` syntax only; the other two profiles have no analogous
inventory need yet (their trust-model assumptions surface through
`axiom_honesty`'s profile-driven `trust_patterns`, not this module).

Declaration-boundary matching is
`gate.provers.decl_syntax.decl_line_regex_for`, the single source for
every consumer.

    provers with no line-comment syntax, e.g. isabelle/rocq's `None`),
    nested `comment_syntax.block_open`/`block_close` block comments, and
    skips over `"..."` string literals so a comment marker inside a
    string isn't treated as a comment. Comment characters are replaced
    with spaces, so line numbers and column offsets in the stripped text
    match the original.

    `comment_syntax.verbatim_delimiters` — isabelle's cartouche,
    `\<open>…\<close>`, `None` for lean4 and rocq — is a nesting bracket
    whose content the prover's own lexer does not scan for comment
    markers, so inside it a `block_open` is ordinary text. Read that
    field's docstring before touching this: without it one `\<open>(*)\<close>`
    (HOL's multiplication operator) blanked every declaration to the end
    of the file, and an invisible declaration's statement can be
    rewritten past a blocking check.

    **Precedence between the two, both verified against
    Isabelle2025-2's own build rather than reasoned about:** a comment
    wins on the outside (`(* … \<open> … *)` closes normally — the
    cartouche opener inside a comment is inert), and a cartouche wins on
    the inside (`\<open>(*)\<close>` and even the unbalanced
    `\<^verbatim>\<open>(*\<close>` of `Doc/Isar_Ref/Document_Preparation.thy`
    build fine — the comment opener inside a cartouche is inert). A
    `"` inside a cartouche is likewise ordinary text, matching
    `gate.provers.isabelle._scan_line`'s model: Isabelle prose is full
    of unbalanced quotes inside cartouches
    (`subsubsection\<open>… All Parts" of a Message\<close>`), and
    treating that one as a string opener suppresses comment detection
    for everything up to the next `"` in the file.

    **There is a second blanker**, `gate.provers.isabelle.
    _blank_isabelle_comments`, serving that module's statement
    extractor. The two agree on every shape tried except Isabelle's
    marginal `\<comment> \<open>…\<close>` comment, which that one blanks
    and this one does not. Read its `_BLANKER_DUPLICATION` note before
    unifying them: merging measured **-15 real declarations** across the
    Isabelle2025-2 distribution against +2, and the blocker is
    multi-line declaration-name capture, not the blankers themselves.
