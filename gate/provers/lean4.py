"""The lean4 prover profile — the reference profile (design note 12 §3.1).

`extract_lean_statement` scans from the declaration keyword to whichever
of `declVal`'s three shapes (`declValSimple <|> declValEqns <|>
whereStructInst`, per `Lean/Parser/Command.lean`) ends the signature;
`gate/verify/statement_equiv.py` delegates to it.

`trust_report_command`/`parse_trust_report` implement the
environment-level trust report (design note 12 §4): a `#print axioms`
probe run via `lake env lean`.

`qualify_decl_names` computes the name the prover actually resolves, so
it is the one fed to trust-report probe targets. That is why it stays
separate from the shared `gate.provers.decl_syntax.qualify_by_scope`,
which computes only a stable disambiguation key — see its docstring.

# "statement" is its whole declaration. `_KEYWORD`'s alternation is
# built from this tuple so the two cannot drift apart;
# `gate.verify.statement_immutability` (spec D2) reads it via
# `ProverProfile.statement_keywords` to decide, per declaration, whether
# to compare just the statement or the whole span.
_STATEMENT_KEYWORDS = ("theorem", "lemma", "def", "abbrev", "instance", "example")

# The definition-bearing half of `_STATEMENT_KEYWORDS`
# (`ProverProfile.definition_keywords`): kinds whose *body* is content
# rather than a proof, so `gate.verify.statement_immutability` compares
# their whole declaration instead of just the statement — unless the base
# body is still a placeholder, the blueprint-fill case. Checked against a
# locally installed toolchain (leanprover--lean4---v4.32.0):
#
# - `def`, `abbrev` — the body is content. `def foo : Nat := 5` with
#   `theorem downstream : foo = 5 := by rfl` compiles; changing only the
#   body to `:= 6` leaves `downstream`'s text byte-identical and it stops
#   compiling. That is the hole this tuple exists to close.
# - `instance` — an instance body can be *data*, and typeclass resolution
#   supplies it implicitly, so a downstream theorem never names it: the
#   hardest redefinition for any statement-text audit to see. Pinning it
#   has a real cost, because a `Prop`-valued class instance genuinely IS
#   proof-irrelevant (`class Fact (p : Prop) : Prop`), so a legitimate
#   golf of one reads as a false `CHANGED`, and the keyword cannot tell
#   the two apart.
#
#   The tie breaks toward pinning on cost asymmetry, NOT because the
#   check is cheap to be wrong about — `statement-immutability` is
#   `CheckClass.TRUST` and blocks a merge on lean4 and isabelle
#   (`gate.checks.PROVER_OVERRIDES` relaxes rocq only), so a false
#   `CHANGED` here stops a merge rather than filing a report. What makes
#   that acceptable is the same property the whole promotion rested on:
#   a false block is one `choir-defect` comment from resolution and the
#   orchestrator decides (spec D5), whereas the miss is silent — nothing
#   downstream names the instance, so no other blocking check and no
#   human reading the diff is likely to catch a rewritten body.
#
#   Frequency here is UNMEASURED, unlike the rates that decided the
#   promotion: `scripts/measure_statement_immutability.py` samples
#   `proof_bearing=("theorem", "lemma", "example")` on lean4, so its
#   0.26% golf false-block rate does not cover instance golfing at all.
#   If that ever becomes noise in a real project, measure it before
#   removing `instance` from this tuple — dropping it reopens the
#   hardest-to-see redefinition in the language.
#
# Deliberately NOT here, i.e. proof-bearing and statement-compared:
#
# - `theorem`/`lemma` — a `theorem`'s type must be a `Prop`, verified by
#   rejection: `theorem notaprop : Nat := 5` fails with "type of theorem
#   `notaprop` is not a proposition". So the body is always a proof,
#   proof irrelevance applies, and `golf` keeps working. `lemma` is
#   Mathlib's macro expanding to `theorem` (core Lean 4 does not define
#   it), so it inherits the restriction.
# - `example` — anonymous, so nothing can reference it and no downstream
#   statement's meaning can follow its body.

    Lean's `declVal` (the right-hand side of a declaration) is exactly
    one of three shapes — `declValSimple <|> declValEqns <|>
    whereStructInst`, per `Lean/Parser/Command.lean` — and this scans for
    whichever of their leading tokens is reached first, left to right,
    all guarded by `depth == 0`:

    - a top-level `:=` (`declValSimple`) — returns the index just past
      it, so the signature keeps the `:=`.
    - a line-initial `|` at or deeper than `decl_indent` **that a `=>`
      confirms** (`declValEqns`, an equation-style definition) — returns
      the index of the `|` itself, excluding it; the caller's `.strip()`
      drops the whitespace this leaves.
    - a standalone `where` (`whereStructInst`) — returns the index just
      past the keyword.

    **Why the `|` needs confirming.** Terminating at *every* line-initial
    `|` was a fail-open: a *statement* wrapping onto a line beginning
    with `|` — Mathlib writes `|a - b|` for `abs` and wraps at the
    operator — was truncated at the bar, so a real rewrite of such a
    conclusion compared equal and read UNCHANGED. Narrowing by
    declaration *kind* does not work, and the toolchain says so:
    `«theorem» := "theorem " >> declId >> declSig >> declVal` over the
    same three-way `declVal`, so `theorem` admits equation alternatives
    exactly as `def` does (`theorem tfun : Nat → True` with `| 0 =>
    trivial` arms compiles on v4.32.0). What does distinguish them is
    `matchAlt := "| " >> ppIndent (patterns >> darrow >> …)`: every
    alternative contains a `=>`. So a candidate `|` is remembered rather
    than acted on, and terminates the signature only if a top-level `=>`
    is reached before a top-level `:=` or `where`.

    Residual: an *unbracketed* `fun x => …` at depth zero inside a type,
    after a line-initial `|`, still misfires. (Mathlib's `fun x ↦ …`
    cannot — `darrow` is the ASCII `=>` token specifically.)
