"""Style audit (Phase 3 — minimal v0).

CLAUDE.md lists "style audit (length, identifier reuse, definition
reuse)" in the verify pipeline. v0 ships the simplest of the three:

- **Length check.** For each top-level declaration in changed files,
  count the lines from its declaration line up to the next top-level
  decl (or EOF). Anything beyond `threshold_lines` (default 200) is
  flagged.

Deferred to future iterations (would benefit from real Lean parsing):

- **Identifier reuse / shadowing.** Detecting that a new local binding
  collides with an existing identifier in scope, or that a definition
  reuses a name already defined elsewhere in the project.
- **Definition reuse.** Detecting that a new definition is structurally
  equivalent to one already in the repo — this is the coherence
  indexer's job (Phase 5), not the style audit's.

The length check is ADVISORY (spec 2026-08-17 D9): it reports over-threshold
declarations for reviewer attention but does not block merge. Length is a soft
signal for the orchestrator's review, not a merge gate — an honest proof may
legitimately be long. Projects tune it via `.choir/verify.toml`
`[audits.style] threshold_lines` (default 200; read from the PR's base SHA)
— domains with genuinely long proofs (heavy algebra/combinatorics) raise it;
teaching repos that want tight proofs lower it.

The compare semantics match the other count-and-compare audits:
*new* long declarations in the head version that weren't long in the
base flag the PR. Pre-existing long declarations stay pre-existing —
the audit doesn't retroactively block PRs that touch a file
containing them.

    Alignment is *enforced*, not assumed. `strip_comments` overwrites
    comment characters with spaces and never inserts or deletes, so
    positions survive — but it preserves only `\\n`, and
    `str.splitlines()` also breaks on `\\r`, form feeds and a handful
    of Unicode separators. One of those inside a comment would be
    blanked to a space, dropping a line boundary and shifting every
    later index. So any such character is restored from the original
    before splitting, and a length mismatch (impossible today) is
    padded/truncated rather than left to raise or silently misindex.

    `strip_comments` runs once over the whole text rather than per
    line, because block-comment depth is carried across line breaks: a
    multi-line block's interior lines are only recognized as
    still-inside-the-comment by a scan that started at the opener.

    - a blank line, or a line that is entirely comment (its blanked
      copy strips to nothing) — skipped without ending the span and
      without extending it, so a comment between two body lines stays
      inside and a trailing one stays outside;
    - a line indented deeper than the declaration's own line — body,
      whatever it says;
    - a line-initial `|` at or deeper than the declaration's own
      indentation — also body. Every prover writes match/constructor
      alternatives that way, all three legally at column zero, and no
      prover has a *command* that starts with `|`. Explicit rather than
      resting on the coincidence that nothing in the allowlist below
      starts with `|` either.
    - a line matching `_trailer_re(profile.non_body_commands)` or the
      profile's standalone-attribute-line pattern — never body, ends the
      span.

    `continuation` is `continuation_lines_for(profile, stripped_lines)`
    — the 0-based indices of lines that BEGIN inside an unterminated
    multi-line quoted or verbatim region (empty on lean4 and rocq).
    Skipped outright, because isabelle lets a type or term run across
    lines inside `"…"`, so such a line's first token is HOL text, not a
    command: `definition bar :: "nat\n  end " where …` builds, and
    without this its span ended at the word `end`.

    Anything else — *including a line this function has never seen the
    shape of* — is attributed to the body. An allowlist of "lines that
    are not body" is unbounded, so an unnamed command shape is
    over-attributed to the *preceding* declaration. Deliberate
    direction: for an advisory check, false-blocking an untouched
    declaration beats letting a real edit read `UNCHANGED`. Do not
    replace this with an indentation rule — that fails in the opposite
    direction (a column-zero `structure` with column-zero fields
    compiles on v4.32.0, gets a one-line span, and a retyped field
    reads `UNCHANGED`).

    Never returns a value below `start_idx`: a single-line declaration
    stays a single-line declaration.
