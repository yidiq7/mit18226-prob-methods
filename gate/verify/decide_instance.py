"""Decide-instance audit (Phase 3, sibling to axiom_honesty).

CLAUDE.md non-negotiable lists this alongside the axiom-honesty audit:
PRs that introduce new `Decidable` instances or pull in `Classical.*`
helpers need human review before merge.

Why this is its own audit (not folded into axiom_honesty):

- `native_decide` bypasses the kernel and is caught by axiom_honesty.
- `decide` as a tactic *uses* `Decidable` instances; it's safe iff
  those instances are correct. A new `instance : Decidable P` that
  evaluates wrong is the equivalent of an axiom for trust purposes.
- `Classical.choice` is the foundational axiom of classical logic in
  Lean; `Classical.dec` / `Classical.decide` / `Classical.propDecidable`
  / `Classical.byContradiction` all pull on it.

For projects that want a constructive formalization, any net increase
in these flags the PR for human review.

v0 is regex-based (matches axiom_honesty's approach). Multi-line
instance declarations and references inside type expressions are
known false-positive / false-negative sources; real Lean parsing is
the v1 fix.
