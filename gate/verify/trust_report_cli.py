"""CLI: environment-level trust report for a set of declarations.

Design note 12 §4 — this is the "generalize RepoProver's #1 borrow"
check: after a rebuild, ask the *built environment* (not text scanning)
what a declaration's trust boundary actually is. Informational only:
this check never blocks merge, so it always exits 0 on a successful
probe run — whether or not any declaration turns out to depend on
axioms/oracles. Exit 2 is reserved for infrastructure errors: a bad
`--workspace`, an unresolvable/unknown prover, or the probe subprocess
itself failing to run or compile.

Unlike the delta audits (`axiom_honesty_cli`, `sorry_delta_cli`, ...),
this CLI has no PR/base-SHA context — it runs against a plain
workspace checkout (a PR head, a worker's clone, or an overseer's
local project). Prover resolution is therefore the same pattern as
`gate/state/intake_cli.py`'s default-branch read: `--prover` flag,
else `[project].prover` from the *workspace's own* `.choir/project.toml`
(default lean4).

Two modes (design note 12 §4.1):

- **Explicit** (`--decl`, repeatable fully-qualified names, plus
  `--import`, repeatable modules/theories/sessions the probe needs in
  scope): unchanged since v0, byte-compatible with existing callers.
  With no `--decl` given at all, the run is a documented no-op.
- **Auto** (`--base-sha <sha>`, mutually exclusive with `--decl`):
  `gate.verify.changed_decls.detect_changed_decls` diffs `base_sha`
  against the workspace's current checkout for changed/new
  declarations (capped at 50, deterministically ordered), then probes
  each one individually via `collect_trust_report`. A `ProverError` on
  one declaration becomes an `unresolved` report line instead of
  failing the run — an informational check must never die on one
  unresolvable name. This is what
  `.github/workflows/verify-trust-report.yml` invokes.

Exit 0 in every reporting outcome (clean, dirty, unresolved, empty
detection, cap truncation) — 2 stays reserved for infrastructure
errors: a bad `--workspace`, an unresolvable/unknown prover, a
git-plumbing failure in detection, or the probe subprocess itself
failing to run or compile.
