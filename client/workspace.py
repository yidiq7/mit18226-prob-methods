"""Workspace setup for a claimed Choir task.

After a successful claim, the contributor CLI clones the project repo
into a per-issue workspace, checks out the pinned commit, creates the
topic branch, and drops the issue body verbatim as `TASK.md`. The
contributor (or their agent) does the work in this workspace; `choir
submit` reads the lease metadata to push and open the PR.

Workspace layout::

    ~/.choir/work/<owner>/<repo>/<issue>/
    ├── .git/
    ├── .choir-lease.json     # metadata read by `choir submit`
    ├── TASK.md               # issue prose verbatim
    └── ...                   # project tree at the pinned commit

The root directory can be overridden via `$CHOIR_WORK_ROOT` (mostly for
tests; the default is fine in production).

# CHOIR.md — workspace primer for your agent

You are reading this from inside a Choir-managed workspace at
`~/.choir/work/<owner>/<repo>/<issue>/`. A human contributor claimed an
open issue on a project using the `{profile.name}` prover, and the
`choir` CLI prepared this directory for you. This file describes the
contract — read it once, then act.

## Your job

Produce one or more commits on the currently-checked-out topic branch
(`choir/<issue>-<slug>`) that close the task described in `TASK.md`.
That's it. When you exit cleanly, `choir submit` will push the branch
and open a PR linked to the issue.

You may push and open a PR yourself if you prefer — Choir's submit step
is idempotent and reuses an existing PR rather than creating a duplicate.

## Files in this directory

- `TASK.md` — the issue body verbatim. This is the spec.
- `.choir-lease.json` — metadata: `target_decl`, `target_file`,
  `task_type`, the GitHub repo and issue number. Read for context;
  don't edit.
- `.choir-context.md` — the maintainer's **current** project guidance
  (conventions, naming, forbidden patterns, dependency rules), synced to
  the latest at task start and assembled for you. **Read it and follow
  it** before making structural or stylistic decisions. (Absent only if
  the project has authored no skill pack yet — then use your defaults.)
  If a committed `skills/` directory exists at the pinned commit, treat it
  as a possibly-stale snapshot — `.choir-context.md` is the authoritative,
  current guidance.
  The raw synced files sit under `.choir-skills/`; both are Choir-managed
  and git-excluded — never edit or commit them.
- `CHOIR.md` — this file.
- `roadmap/`, when the project keeps one — the plan: `README.md` for the
  route, a file per group for the mathematics, and `graph.json` listing
  every declaration the plan knows about with what depends on what.
  Search it for lemmas the project already has before writing your own.
- The rest of the directory is the project itself, checked out at the
  pinned commit recorded in `.choir-lease.json`.

## Pre-installed on the contributor's machine

- {toolchain_line}
- If you have library/lemma/theorem search tooling configured,
  use it before guessing or inventing a name — that's the single
  highest-leverage habit for proving here, whichever proof assistant
  this project uses.

## Conventions to follow

- **Stay focused on `target_decl`.** If you find adjacent issues you'd
  want to fix, leave them — the verify pipeline marks out-of-scope
  diffs for human attention.
- **Do not edit protected files**: {protected}. These are pinned by the
  project maintainer.
- **Do not introduce new {placeholders} placeholders.** Leaving one in
  place of a real proof is a documented return state, not a silent
  pass — the verify pipeline tracks net-new placeholders in your
  submission.
- **Do not introduce new {trust_labels}.** The verify pipeline flags
  these as trust-eroding and a human reviewer must approve before merge.
- **Do not weaken the statement of `target_decl` to make it provable.**
  The verify pipeline catches this: PRs whose base and head signatures
  differ for `target_decl` fail the statement-equivalence audit.

## What you should NOT do

- Do not read or write files outside this workspace for credentials,
  API keys, or contributor state. Choir never proxies credentials and
  there are none to find here.
- Do not open new issues or PRs unrelated to `target_decl`.
- Do not force-push. The submit flow assumes a normal fast-forward.
