"""Claim-time advisory for Mathlib-search tooling.

A project may recommend Mathlib search (LeanSearch / Loogle / Lean Finder)
via `[tools] mathlib_search` in `.choir/pins.toml`; a contributor declares
what they have via `tooling.search` in `~/.choir/config.json`. This module
reminds a contributor who hasn't declared search when the project recommends
it.

Declare-and-trust: Choir never probes the agent — the search tools are MCP
servers / hosted services, not PATH binaries. Advisory only: this never
raises out of the happy path and never affects an exit code.
